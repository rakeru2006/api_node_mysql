## Usage 
:speech_balloon:  :hammer: :eyeglasses: 
  ***
We are going to create this code to show, help and Learn and experiment

## Installation 
:feet:
***

Small description step by step that tells how to run and develop the aplication 
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.

```
 npm install
 npm i express
 npm init
 node server.js
``` 
## Running Locally

How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Use the [MySQL](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) NPM package to connect to your MySQL database and perform queries.

* Use [InquirerJs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/0.2.3) NPM package to interact with the user via the command-line.

* Use [console.table](https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table) to print MySQL rows to the console. There is a built-in version of `console.table`, but the NPM package formats the data a little better for our purposes.

* You may wish to have a separate file containing functions for performing specific SQL queries you'll need to use. Could a constructor function or a class be helpful for organizing these?

* You will need to perform a variety of SQL JOINS to complete this assignment, and it's recommended you review the week's activities if you need a refresher on this.
